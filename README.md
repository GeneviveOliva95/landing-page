# landing-page

## About the Project
The Landing Page project is a web page that I have reconstructed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to design web pages using HTML and CSS, and test my knowledge on arranging reponsive elements through CSS Flexible Box Layout.

## Project Description
The purpose of the web page is to visually mimic a basic design that is commonly used by developers, and to ensure the proper use of Flexbox for responsive web design.

The web page itself is meant to serve more as a template rather than a fully functional web page. Although some of the header links do reference other pages, not all of the content is interactive.

To construct the page, I created a repository specifically for the Landing Page project. The Odin Project provided an image of how the web page should appear, and I wrote the code for both HTML and CSS to match the image.

To construct the page, I used the following:
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexible Box Layout
- Visual Studio Code 

I aim to implement dynamic content in the future using JavaScript, design a logo to replace the header logo (located top-left of the page), and add a layer of interactivity by ensuring that all buttons and links are fully functional.

## How to Use the Project
The header links are functional and lead you to the following pages:
- header link one --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_%28character%29
- header link two --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Star
- header link three --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog

The image of the Brooklyn Bridge is not interactive.

Note: I sectioned both HTML and CSS according to content. There are a total of five sections (with section-one as the header and section-five as the footer), allowing other developers to visibly see the structure of the code.
